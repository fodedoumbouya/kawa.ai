# kawa.ai 🚀
Kawa.ai is a platform for building applications using the power of large language models (LLMs). It provides a simple interface to create, manage, and download applications that leverage LLMs for various tasks. 🤖

## Features ✨
Kawa.ai offers a comprehensive suite of features to streamline the development and deployment of LLM-powered applications:

- **Application Creation ⚙️**: Easily create applications leveraging the capabilities of large language models.
- **Application Management 🗂️**: Intuitive interface for managing your applications with ease.
- **Debugging Tools 🛠️**: Built-in debugger compatible with VsCode for seamless debugging.
- **Local Deployment 📥**: Download and run applications locally for testing and development.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility 💻**: Run Kawa.ai on any operating system that supports Golang, Python, and Dart & Flutter.
- **Scalability 📈**: Optimized for performance and scalability, suitable for both small and large applications.

## Requirements ✔️
To install and run Kawa.ai, ensure you have the following dependencies installed on your machine:

- **Golang**: Required for backend services.
- **Python**: Required for certain functionalities and scripts.
- **Dart & Flutter**: Required for frontend development and editing. (Optional if not editing)

## Installation 🔧
To get started with Kawa.ai, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/fodedoumbouya/kawa.ai.git
	```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
	```bash
	cd kawa.ai
	```
3. Install the required dependencies:
	```bash
	make setup
	```
4. Install dependencies and run the application:
	```bash
	make run-all
	```

This command will check for the required dependencies and start all the services. If everything is set up correctly, you should see the following services running with their respective ports:
	| PROJECT         | URL                          | STATUS      |
	|-----------------|------------------------------|-------------|
	| vscode_preview  | http://127.0.0.1:8080        | ✓ Running   |
	| kawa            | http://127.0.0.1:8090        | ✓ Running   |
	| kawa_web        | http://127.0.0.1:8000          | ✓ Running   |

## Usage 🔍
Once Kawa.ai is installed, you can start creating applications using the web interface. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Open your web browser and navigate to:
	```
	http://localhost:8000
	```

2. From the web interface, you can:
	- Create new applications ✨
	- Manage existing applications 🗂️
	- Debug applications using the built-in VsCode debugger 🛠️

## Approach 💡  
Kawa.ai is designed with a modular and scalable architecture that ensures each request to the LLM is self-contained. This means that each request is independent and does not rely on context or state from previous requests. This approach offers several advantages:

- **Modularity**: Each request can be handled independently, allowing for greater flexibility and modularity in application design.
- **Scalability**: Independent requests make it easier to scale applications horizontally, as there is no need to maintain state across requests.
- **Flexibility**: You can seamlessly switch between different LLM models within the same project, enabling diverse use cases and experimentation.
