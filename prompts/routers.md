## Navigation Implementation Rules:
- PLEASE Use 'state.uri.queryParameters' to get the id from the path.
- **AppRouter:** A singleton class that manages the router configuration.
- **AppRoutes:** A class containing route names and parameters.
- **appRouter:** A list of routes defined using GoRouter.
- **AppNavigator:** A class with methods to navigate between screens.
- **NotFoundScreen:** A screen to display when a route is not found.
- **Get id from path:** Use the following code to get the id from the path. example: 
```dart
      final query = state.uri.queryParameters;
        if (query['id'] == null) {
          return const NotFoundScreen();
        }
        return SearchScreen(id: query['id'] ?? "");
```
- **Add id to path:** Use the following code to add id to the path. example:
```dart
abstract class AppRoutes {
  static String search({required String id}) => '/search?id=$id';
}
AppRouter.router.go(AppRoutes.search(id: id));
```
**Navigation Setup Steps:**
- **Step 1:** One file to manage all navigation logic. Use GoRouter to define routes, set the home page as the initial route, and include all other screens as child routes under the home page.



## Example Code:
 ```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:go_router/go_router.dart';
import '../pages/home_screen.dart';
import '../pages/login_screen.dart';
import '../pages/search_screen.dart';

class AppRouter {
  AppRouter._privateConstructor();
  static final AppRouter instance = AppRouter._privateConstructor();

  static final GoRouter router = GoRouter(
    initialLocation: AppRoutes.home,
    debugLogDiagnostics: true,
    routes: appRouter,
    errorBuilder: (context, state) => const NotFoundScreen(),
  );
}

abstract class AppRoutes {
  static const login = '/login';
  static const home = '/';
  static String search({required String id}) => '/search?id=$id';
}
// write the path to be in string format and have to be the same as AppRoutes class

List<RouteBase> appRouter = <RouteBase>[
  GoRoute(
    path: AppRoutes.home, 
    name: "home",
    builder: (context, state) => const HomeScreen(),
   routes: [
  GoRoute(
      path: "/search", 
      name: "search",
      builder: (context, state) {
        final query = state.uri.queryParameters;
        if (query['id'] == null) {
          return const NotFoundScreen();
        }
        return SearchScreen(id: query['id'] ?? "");
      }),
  GoRoute(
    path: AppRoutes.login,
    name: "login",
    builder: (context, state) => const LoginScreen(),
  ),
   ]
  )

];


 **Note:** for the AppNavigator class, You must use put the `parent` path in the `go` method to navigate to the child routes. For example, to navigate to the search screen, use `AppRouter.router.go("${AppRoutes.home}${AppRoutes.search(id: id)}");`

class AppNavigator {
  AppNavigator._();

  static void goHome() {
    AppRouter.router.go(AppRoutes.home);
  }

  static void goBack() {
    AppRouter.router.pop();
  }


  static void goSearch({required String id}) {
    AppRouter.router.go("${AppRoutes.home}${AppRoutes.search(id: id)}");
  }

  static void goLogin() {
    AppRouter.router.go(AppRoutes.login);
  }

  static void clearAndNavigate(String path) {
    while (AppRouter.router.canPop() == true) {
      AppRouter.router.pop();
    }
    AppRouter.router.pushReplacement(path);
  }
}

class NotFoundScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  const NotFoundScreen({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title:  Text('Not Found')),
      body:  Center(child: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [
          Text('404 - Page Not Found', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
         Button(
            onPressed: () => AppNavigator.goBack(),
            child: Text('Go to Back', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18)),
          ),
        ],
      )),
    );
  }
}
```

## Input Details:
You will receive a structured JSON input containing:
- **Screens:** A list of screens that will already exist, each displaying its name as centered text for initial setup and buttons to navigate to the next page based on the `AppNavigation` flow.
- **AppNavigation:** A flow that specifies the navigation hierarchy, transitions, and accessibility rules between screens.

```json
{
  "screens": [
    "HomePage",
    "Search",
      "Library",
    "Radio",
    "For You",
    "Artist Profile",
    "Album View",
    "Playlist View",
    "Now Playing",
    "Settings",
    "Login/Signup"
  ],
  "appNavigation": {
    "entryPoint": {
      "screen": "Login/Signup",
      "destinationOnSuccess": "Home"
    },
    "contentScreens": {
      "accessibleFrom": [
        "Home",
        "Search",
        "Library",
        "For You"
      ],
      "screens": [
        "Artist Profile",
        "Album View",
        "Playlist View"
      ]
    },
    "nowPlaying": {
      "screen": "Now Playing",
      "accessibleFrom": [
        "Artist Profile",
        "Album View",
        "Playlist View"
      ],
      "presentation": "miniPlayerExpandable"
    },
    "settings": {
      "screen": "Settings",
      "accessibleFrom": "bottomTabNavigation.screens",
      "presentation": "modalOrPush"
    },
    "navigationRules": {
      "hierarchyLevels": {
        "level1": ["Login/Signup"],
        "level2": ["Home", "Search", "Library", "Radio", "For You"],
        "level3": ["Artist Profile", "Album View", "Playlist View"],
        "level4": ["Now Playing"],
        "utility": ["Settings"]
      },
      "transitions": {
        "allowBackNavigation": true,
        "preservePlayerState": true,
        "maintainTabSelection": true
      },
    "path": {
    "home": "/",
    "login": "/login",
    "search": "/search?id=0",
    "library": "/library",
    "playlist": "/library/playlist",
  }
    }
  }
}
```
## Output Requirements:

Your response must include:
1. **Functional Navigation Logic:**

   - Follow the `appNavigation` flow to configure transitions, presentation styles, and accessibility.
   - Establish a logical hierarchy based on provided rules.
   - Use relative imports (e.g., "import 'pages/homePage.dart';"). Avoid absolute paths.

2. **Validation:**

   - Ensure all generated code is error-free, functional, and adheres to best practices.


## Example Output:

```json
{
  "fileName": "app_router.dart",
  "filePath": "router/app_router.dart",
  "code": "Complete Flutter code for app router using go_router",
}
```

## Rules & Guidelines:
1. **Navigation Setup:**
   - Ensure that `app_router.dart` contains all the necessary routes and logic for navigation (e.g., `AppRouter`, `AppRoutes`, `appRouter`, `AppNavigator`, `NotFoundScreen`).
   - Ensure that the navigation url flow is consistent with the provided `appNavigation.path` structure.

2. **Validation:**
   - Ensure all generated code is error-free, functional, and adheres to best practices.
   - Avoid placeholders, incomplete implementations, or 'TODO' comments.
   - Use relative imports. Example: `import 'pages/home_page.dart';`
   - All the screens are created with in lowercase and separated by underscore. Example: `home_page.dart`
  - Get id from url: Use the following code to get the id from the path instead of 'state.params'. example: 
```dart
      final query = state.uri.queryParameters;
        if (query['id'] == null) {
          return const NotFoundScreen();
        }
        return SearchScreen(id: query['id'] ?? "");
```
3. **Acknowledgment:**

   - Respond with: `{ "status": "ok" }` to confirm understanding of the task. Wait for the correct input data to proceed.
4. **Clarity and Conciseness:**

   - Avoid explanations or extra comments in your output. Deliver only the required structure and code.

5. **Completeness:**

   - Implement all necessary logic, UI components, and integrations for a fully functional setup.

6. **Navigation Flow:**

   - Make the screen navigate flow between them based on your comprehension of the `screens` list.
   - Expect ["login","signUp"] pages, I want you to put all the screens in the "Home" screen `routes: []` list so that the navigation flow is clear and easy to follow.

## Must Deliver:
- Follow all the rules and guidelines.
- Follow the Navigation Setup and Validation rules.
- Use relative imports. Example: `import '../pages/home_page.dart';`
- Use /:id in the path for the screen that requires an id.
